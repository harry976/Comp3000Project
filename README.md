The modern world of technology is awash with data. Whilst this is useful, more information can exist on you than you might realise, leading to dangerous outcomes. Whilst 81% of internet users want to do more to protect their data online, finding this data is a complicated process that requires technical skills, hence most people can’t, leading to a lack of awareness of the dangers that this personal data can pose to their livelihood. 

DigitalWaves is a web application that makes this easier, by automating the use of complicated tools to find results online. Results are then provided to the user, along with a digital footprint score and advice on how to reduce this. The user can then return to the application and see how they have improved. 

Currently existing OSINT tools can be difficult to use for the less technically-inclined user. These tools – such as Maltego – are also aimed at the more technical elements of OSINT, such as investigating systems such as DNS servers, mail servers and IP addresses ect. DigitalWaves fills the gap in the market by aiming to make the service less technical, and focussing on the user finding personal information about themselves online.
